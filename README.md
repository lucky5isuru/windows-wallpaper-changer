Change Windows Desktop Wallpaper
This is a simple Python script to change the Windows desktop wallpaper using given wallpapers in a specified folder. This script enables you to set your wallpaper to change at specified intervals and provides the option to select different wallpapers from a given folder.

Prerequisites
Python 3: This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine. If you don't already have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official website.
Windows: This script is designed to only work on Windows operating systems.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine.

Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the wallpaper.py file in your favourite Python editor or IDE

Edit the code at the top of the script to include the folder location of the images you want to use:

DIR_PATH = '/path/to/folder/with/images'
You can customize the time interval between each wallpaper change by editing the following line of code:

INTERVAL = 3600  # specify the interval in seconds
In the above example, the wallpaper will change every hour (3600 seconds). You can change this to your desired interval.
